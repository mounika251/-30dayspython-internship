# 1. Create 3 variables (a, b, c) to same value of any integer & do the following 
# a) divide a by 10
# b) multiply b by 50
# c) add c by 60

a=b=c=40
div=int(a/10)
mul=int(b*50)
add=int(c+60)
Print("divided a by 10 =",div)
print("multiply b by 50 =",mul) 
print("add c by 60 =",add) 


Output 
divide a by 10 = 4
multiply b by 50 = 2000
add c by 60 = 100

#2. Create a string variable of 5 characters and replace the 3 rd character with g 

str="madam"
rep=str.replace("d","g")
Print("replace 3 rd character with g is ",rep)

Output
replace 3 rd character with g is magam

#3.create 2 values (a, b) of int, float data type and convert the vice versa 

a=input('Enter the value of a = ')
b=input('Enter the value of b = ')
a=int(a)
b=float(b)
c=float(a)
d=int(b)
Print('before converting the value of a is in int data type ',a) 
print('converting the value a from int to float ',c) 
print('before converting the value of b is in float data type ',b) 
print('converting the value of b from float to int ',d) 

Output

Enter the value of a = 5
Enter the value of b = 10
before converting the value of a is in int data type 5)
converting the value of a from int to float 5.0
before converting the value of b is in float data type 10.0
converting the value of b from float to int 10
